# How to use Arches' Thesauri  

## Terminology  
  
- **Concept:** a qualitative property; e.g. "stone", "House", "XRD Dataset", "building"  
- **Thesaurus:** a set of concepts  
- **Collection:** *custom* aggregation of Concepts used in dropdown lists within a Resource Model  
    - **It is necessary for the Concept to exist in a Thesaurus to be able to add the Concept to a Collection**

## Steps **I** follow:

1. Within *RDM*, on the "Thesauri" tab, search for a Concept you know currently exists on the list where you want to add a new item.
1. Access the higher level Concept
1. *Add child* with the new Concept you wish to add to the dropdown list.
1. Go to the "Collections" tab
1. Search again for the currently existing Concept
    1. If more than one option appears, it'd be best to find what Collection is the Resource Model using directly from the "Resource Manager" site.
1. Find the collection
1. *Add dropdown item*; choose your new Concept
